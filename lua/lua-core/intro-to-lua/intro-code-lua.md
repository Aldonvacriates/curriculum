# Hello World

---
## Content

Like with every other language, let's write our first "hello world" program to help you get used to coding!

When you run this code, you should find the words, "Hello world!" in the terminal[1].

```lua
print("Hello, world!")
-- Hello, world!
```

In the coding segment [2]:

- The `--` is used to denote a **single line comment**. These often contain notes written by the author!

> In most cases, notes will often contain the output for code.

- The `print("Hello, world!")` is used to **output the string**[3] "Hello, world!" to the terminal.

 
---

## Practice

Finish the code below to print out "Hello world!" to the terminal.

```lua
???("Hello, world!")
-- Hello, world!
```

- `print`
- `Print`
- `terminal`
- `Terminal`

## Revision

In the code below, what is the purpose of line 2? ???

```lua
print("Hello, world!")
-- Hello, world!
```

- Describe the output of the line above
- A fail-safe in case the line above doesn't execute
- To tell the system to print the words after `--`
- To say hello to the system!
